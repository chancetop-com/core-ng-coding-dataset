    "query": "What is the best way to manage database entities using the core-ng framework?",
    "response": "The recommended approach is to use the `Repository` interface provided by core-ng for CRUD operations on database entities. This ensures type safety, clear separation of concerns, and efficient database interactions. In the `OrderPaymentService` file, the `orderPaymentRepository` is injected and used for operations like `selectOne`, `update`, and `partialUpdate`. For example, the `getOrderPayment` method uses `selectOne` with a query parameter to fetch a single entity, and throws a `NotFoundException` if the entity is not found. This demonstrates clean and idiomatic usage of the repository pattern.",

    "query": "How should conditional business logic be structured for readability and maintainability?",
    "response": "The best practice is to use clear and concise conditional blocks that encapsulate specific business rules, avoiding deeply nested or overly complex logic. In the `OrderPaymentService` file, the `cancelOrderWithPayment` method demonstrates this principle by using sequential `if` statements to handle different payment statuses and channel types. Each condition is self-contained and maps directly to a specific business rule, making the code easy to read and maintain.",

    "query": "What is the recommended way to handle external service integrations in core-ng applications?",
    "response": "The best practice is to encapsulate external service calls within dedicated methods and use dependency injection to manage service clients. This ensures modularity, testability, and separation of concerns. In the `OrderPaymentService` file, external services like `PaymentWebService` and `SquareOrderIntegrationWebService` are injected and used within methods like `refund` and `isMerchantPaymentGatewayAvailable`. For example, the `refund` method constructs a `RefundPaymentRequest` object and calls the `paymentWebService.refund` method, encapsulating the integration logic within a single method for clarity and reusability.",

  {
    "query": "How can state updates be handled efficiently in core-ng applications?",
    "response": "The recommended approach is to create a new instance of the entity with updated fields and use the repository's `update` or `partialUpdate` methods to persist changes. This avoids mutating the original entity and ensures consistency. In the `OrderPaymentService` file, the `updatedOrderPayment` method creates a new `OrderPayment` instance, calculates updated fields like `refundedAmount` and `paymentStatus`, and returns the updated entity. This method is then used in various workflows, such as refunds and cancellations, ensuring efficient and consistent state updates.",
