    "query": "How does the `ExecutorImpl` class ensure that tasks are properly tracked and logged, especially in the context of shutdown scenarios?",
    "response": "The `ExecutorImpl` class uses a `ReentrantLock` to synchronize access to the `scheduler` and `executor` during shutdown. It maintains a `runningTasks` set to track tasks that are currently being executed. During shutdown, it logs any tasks that are canceled due to the shutdown process using the `logger.warn` method with the `TASK_REJECTED` error code. This ensures that all tasks are accounted for and any issues during shutdown are properly logged."
  },
  {
    "query": "What is the purpose of the `scheduleDelayedTask` method in `ExecutorImpl`, and how does it handle task rejection?",
    "response": "The `scheduleDelayedTask` method is designed to schedule tasks to be executed after a specified delay. It constructs the task execution context outside the scheduler thread to obtain the parent action log. If the scheduler rejects the task due to shutdown, it catches the `RejectedExecutionException` and logs a warning with the `TASK_REJECTED` error code. This method ensures that delayed tasks are either scheduled or properly logged if rejected."
  },
  {
    "query": "Why does `ExecutorImpl` use the `LogManager.ID_GENERATOR` to generate action IDs, and how does this integrate with the logging system?",
    "response": "The `ExecutorImpl` uses `LogManager.ID_GENERATOR` to generate unique action IDs for each task. This ensures that each task can be individually tracked and logged. The action ID is used in conjunction with the `ActionLog` to provide detailed logging information about the task's execution, including its start time, duration, and any errors that occur. This integration with the logging system allows for comprehensive monitoring and debugging of asynchronous tasks."
  },
  {
    "query": "How does `ExecutorImpl` handle the submission of tasks with different types, such as `Callable` and `Task`?",
    "response": "The `ExecutorImpl` class provides overloaded `submit` methods to handle different types of tasks. For `Callable` tasks, it directly submits the task and returns a `Future<T>`. For `Task` tasks, it wraps the task in a `CallableTask` to preserve task class information and then submits it. This design allows for flexibility in handling various task types while ensuring that all tasks are properly tracked and logged."
  },
  {
    "query": "What is the role of the `DelayedTask` inner class in `ExecutorImpl`, and how does it contribute to task scheduling?",
    "response": "The `DelayedTask` inner class in `ExecutorImpl` is used to wrap tasks that need to be executed after a delay. It implements `Callable<Void>` and overrides the `call` method to submit the task for execution. This class ensures that delayed tasks are properly scheduled and executed, and it provides a `toString` method to print all canceled tasks during shutdown. This contributes to the overall task scheduling mechanism by handling delayed execution and logging any issues that arise."
