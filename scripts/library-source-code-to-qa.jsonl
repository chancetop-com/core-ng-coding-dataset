    "query": "What is the purpose of the `HTTPStatus` enum in the framework, and how does it contribute to HTTP response handling?",
    "response": "The `HTTPStatus` enum serves as a centralized representation of standard HTTP status codes within the framework. By defining these codes as constants, it ensures consistency and readability when handling HTTP responses. Developers can use these predefined values instead of hardcoding integers, reducing errors and improving maintainability. This design aligns with the framework's goal of providing a robust API for HTTP communication.",

    "response": "The `code` field is declared as `public final` to make it immutable and directly accessible. This design choice ensures that the HTTP status code associated with each enum constant cannot be modified after initialization, preserving the integrity of the status codes. Additionally, making it public allows for straightforward access without requiring getter methods, simplifying usage and adhering to the framework's principle of minimizing boilerplate code.",

    "response": "The `HTTPStatus` enum is typically used in conjunction with HTTP response handling classes to set or validate the status code of a response. For example, when constructing an HTTP response, developers can reference `HTTPStatus.OK` or `HTTPStatus.NOT_FOUND` to set the appropriate status code. This interaction ensures that the framework's HTTP communication adheres to standard protocols and provides a clear, type-safe way to manage status codes.",

    "response": "Including both client error (4xx) and server error (5xx) codes in `HTTPStatus` reflects the framework's comprehensive approach to HTTP communication. By covering the full range of standard status codes, the framework enables developers to handle diverse scenarios, from client-side validation failures to server-side issues.

    "response": "Using an enum for HTTP status codes provides several advantages over a class with static constants. Enums inherently group related constants together, making the code more organized and self-documenting. Additionally, enums can have associated fields and methods, as seen with the `code` field in `HTTPStatus`, allowing for more expressive and type-safe usage.

    "response": "The `@Property` annotation is used to explicitly define the name of a field when serializing or deserializing JSON objects. This allows developers to map Java field names to specific JSON property names, which is particularly useful when the field name in the Java class does not match the desired JSON key.

Another issue is the reliance on reflection, which can introduce performance overhead. The framework mitigates these risks by providing comprehensive error messages during runtime when a mismatch is detected, and by optimizing its reflection-based logic to minimize performance impact.

This design choice implies that the validator is tightly coupled to the `BeanValidatorNotBlankTest.Bean` class, making it unsuitable for generic validation across different bean types.

For example, `validateChild1` validates a single `Child` object, `validateChild2` handles a collection of `Child` objects (`children`), and `validateChild3` deals with a map of `Child` objects (`childMap`).
